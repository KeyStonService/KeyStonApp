# Root Governance Analysis & Refactoring - Task Management

## Phase 1: Preparation & Discovery
- [x] Initialize project workspace and analysis environment
- [x] Create comprehensive task breakdown and execution plan
- [x] Set up file tracking and version control for deliverables
- [x] Test git push and PR capabilities (identified authentication limitation)

## Phase 2: Global Best Practices Research
- [x] Search for automated registry maintenance best practices
- [x] Research multi-stage generative architecture governance patterns
- [x] Investigate semantic closure, DAG, and artifact closure methodologies
- [x] Analyze world-class governance frameworks and semantic root strategies
- [x] Compile findings into structured best practices repository (research/01-best-practices-research.md created)

## Phase 3: Root Directory Architecture Analysis
- [x] Analyze current root/ directory structure and configuration files
- [x] Map existing subsystem integrations (governance, modules, trust, provenance)
- [x] Identify current governance gaps and semantic drift issues
- [x] Evaluate module isolation and architecture conflicts
- [x] Document current state assessment report (research/03-root-architecture-analysis.md created)

## Phase 4: Bi-Directional Governance Loop Design
- [x] Design semantic expansion vs backward reconciliation model
- [x] Create FileX standard template with forward + backward propagation (design/FileX-standard-template-v1.yaml created)
- [x] Define semantic closure rules and validation mechanisms (design/semantic-closure-rules.md created)
- [x] Design automatic diff + reconciliation workflow (defined in FileX template)
- [x] Establish semantic root update mechanism (root/.root.semantic-root.yaml created with complete update workflow)

## Phase 5: Root Directory Redesign & Configuration
- [x] Design comprehensive root/ file structure specification (defined in research/03-root-architecture-analysis.md)
- [x] Create .root.semantic-root.yaml - semantic root v1.0.0 configuration
- [x] Create .root.gates.map.yaml - gate mechanisms and CI/CD integration
- [x] Create .root.init.d/ with initialization scripts (00-init.sh, 01-semantic-root-init.sh created)
- [x] Create .root.jobs/ directory with attestation bundles (structure created)
- [x] Create comprehensive README.md for root directory
- [x] Phase 5 complete - All root configuration files implemented

## Phase 6: Subsystem Integration & Collaboration Strategy
- [ ] Design unified configuration format and interface standards
- [ ] Create data flow and cross-subsystem reference architecture
- [ ] Implement automated coordination and error isolation mechanisms
- [ ] Design centralized gate workflow for monitoring and coordination
- [ ] Create traceability and responsibility mapping system

## Phase 7: Implementation & Validation
- [ ] Implement all root configuration files in workspace
- [ ] Create subsystem integration examples and documentation
- [ ] Design CI/CD pipeline templates for governance closure
- [ ] Create automated validation and testing framework
- [ ] Implement semantic consistency drift detection

## Phase 8: Documentation & Delivery
- [ ] Create comprehensive governance framework documentation
- [ ] Generate best practices extraction report
- [ ] Create implementation guide and migration strategies
- [ ] Design FileX template usage documentation
- [ ] Package all deliverables into structured delivery format

## Completion Criteria
- [ ] All root configuration files implemented and validated
- [ ] Bi-directional governance loop fully documented
- [ ] Semantic closure rules operational
- [ ] Subsystem integration architecture complete
- [ ] Best practices repository comprehensive
- [ ] All documentation delivered in structured format
